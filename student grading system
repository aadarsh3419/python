This Python class simulates a student grading system.

__init__: Initializes student name and marks.

grade(): Prints the student's name, marks, and whether they Passed ✅ or Failed ❌ based on a passing mark of 40.

Two students (Aalok and Aadarsh) are created with different marks.

The result is printed for each student.

📌 Logic:
If a student's marks are ≥ 40, they pass.
If marks are < 40, they fail.

class Student: 
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name
        self.marks = marks

    def grade(self):
        print(f"Marks of {self.name} is {self.marks}")
        if self.marks >= 40:
            print("Result: Passed ✅\n")
        else:
            print("Result: Failed ❌\n")

# Create students with numeric marks
student1 = Student("Aalok", 38)
student2 = Student("Aadarsh", 89)

student1.grade()
student2.grade()
